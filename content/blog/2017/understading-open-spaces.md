Pycon India is back! Itâ€™s time to meet some amazing Pythonistas, share their experiences and learn a ton from some really inspiring like-minded open source enthusiasts. We are happy to inform you that we have decided to continue with our tradition of open space this year as well. Open spaces are not only a great way to create a vibrant community but also a really useful mode of sharing knowledge and learning from the same.

###What is an Open Space?

Literally, it's a SPACE OPEN to anyone who wishes to talk about Python. Be it experience, learnings, libraries, tools, frameworks, tests, correct code practices, an idea, a "What-not-to-do" talk or anything (in this case about Python).

###How does it work?

Interested people can register for an open space talk. A time slot is allocated, the concerned person gives a talk during the allotted time. Audiences interact and discuss, sharing their opinions. Such small group discussions mostly turn out to be great.

###Why to pre-register?

Just to make arrangements for rooms, projectors and other such requirements. On-spot registration is also allowed, provided there is time slot availability.


###How to participate in Open Space?

Simply register yourself on the [PyCon India CFP](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/) when it's announced. Remember you can also just walk in during the conference.

###Guidelines

- Allowed time slot for each talk is 15-30 minutes.
- Reach the talk arena, 5 minutes before your talk starts.
- Please specify your requirements for the talk in CFP description.
