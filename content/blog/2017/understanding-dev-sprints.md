Has contributing to Open source projects been one of those plans for you that just remained a plan? Or did you try contributing to an Open source project but got lost somewhere in the middle due to lack of guidance? 
Well, dev sprints are here to save the day! During Dev sprints, Mentors/Contributors of Open source projects guide participants through everything, from  generating the development build to submitting a patch for a bug.

It doesnâ€™t matter if you are a newbie or an experienced contributor, just dive in and get to work. It is also a great opportunity to understand and experience the ways of the Open source. Although, there will be situations when you might feel stuck, but there is nothing to worry about as the mentors present there can provide you instant help to get you moving. We can say this from experience, that participants of these dev sprints have not been limited to their Open source contribution just for the conference days.They are still active contributors.

If you are a contributor or have been involved in maintenance of any Open source project place, please come forward. You can submit your proposal for your Dev sprint [here](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/dev-sprint-2017/proposals/). This project can be any interesting Open source project which is based on Python. You should have enough contributions to the project. Your responsibility will be to help your team set up their development environment, list out beginner friendly bugs and guide them on any problems. Deadline for submitting call for proposals is [Date]. Don't hesitate to submit your proposals. Pycon India is Open for everyone.

The dev sprints will be conducted on 2nd and 3rd of November 2017.
