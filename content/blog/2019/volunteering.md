[PyCon India](http://in.pycon.org/) is a community run event. What
that means is, there is no one person or organization behind the
event. People who love the language come together and help in ways
they can, to run the event. And here is the opportunity for *you* to
be a part of the community.

But before you register to volunteer, there are few things you should
be aware of -

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

  * Volunteering takes time and effort, sometimes a lot of it. Online
    activities like handling social networks or handling registrations
    etc take a lot of time. So if you're volunteering, make sure you
    can allocate sufficient time.

  * If you're volunteering for offline activities e.g. on spot
    registration or settings up stages or handling video recording,
    anything that has to be done on the venue during the event, there
    is a good chance that you won't be able to attend the sessions. If
    someone needs you, you have to be there.

  * Volunteering is not a free way into the event. At PyCon India,
    everybody buys a ticket. Even the event organizers buy tickets. We
    volunteer because we love Python and PyCon, and want the event to
    be awesome.

If you're still interested in volunteering, here is what you should do next:

  * Subscribe to [the mailing
    list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/inpycon).

  * Register for volunteering in [this
    form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXp4x5SP73pSRPVYHAzQo7dDdvt_M0JuagMMHxmcBZ4zbDNg/viewform?usp=sf_link). The
    corresponding workgroup lead will get in touch with you, when he /
    she needs support.

  * You can pro-actively "Watch" the following repos for activity and
    track the progress being made. If you can contribute to any of the
    issues, please feel free to pitch-in.
