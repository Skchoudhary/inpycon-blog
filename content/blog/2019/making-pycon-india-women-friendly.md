The vision of PyCon India 2019 is to create an inclusive environment
that promotes knowledge sharing and diversity in thoughts and
ideas. To quote

<blockquote>
We would like to ensure that the conference approaches everyone with
respect, and that we resolve differences peacefully. In particular, we
will proactively extend our invite to women, provide support for
students, and ensure that people with disabilities feel welcome at the
conference.
</blockquote>

Along those lines, we would like to offer the following facilities for
women to welcome their participation:

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

  * For parents travelling with young kids, childcare services will be
    provided at the venue for kids aged 5 years or below. If you want to
    avail childcare for your kid, please mark the checkbox for the
    same in the ticket registration page. 

  * The organizers will arrange a Kids Corner with games,
    entertainment and activities for kids of age 5 to 12. If you want
    to avail Kids Corner for your kid, please mark the checkbox for
    the same in the ticket registration page.

  * A separate room will be available for mothers of very young kids
    for breastfeeding.

  * **The above mentioned facilities are available only for the
     conference days Oct 12th and Oct 13th, 2019**. If there is
     sufficient demand we will consider extending this to the workshop
     day and devsprint as well.

  * On the second day of the conference, a PyLadies Lunch will be
    hosted, which is focused on the discussion regarding the
    challenges, problems, solutions, and experiences among the women
    in technology.

  * PyCon India 2019 takes the experience of the attendees in the
    conference very seriously. We are committed to providing a
    positive, harassment-free conference experience for every women
    participant. We hope the spirit of the Python community will
    transcend to create an harmonious experience. We have a strong <a
    href="https://in.pycon.org/2019/code-of-conduct.html">Code of
    Conduct</a> to set the right expectations and a <a
    href="https://in.pycon.org/2019/reporting-guide.html">Reporting
    Guide</a> to effectively handle any issue that might arise.

    Our team will be happy to help you and assist you to feel safe
    during the duration of the event.

  * You may want to bring a companion/caregiver with you who will not
    be attending the conference. They may just accompany you because
    you are travelling from afar or you have an young kid for whom
    would prefer your own caregiver. In such essential cases, you can
    email us at [tickets@in.pycon.org](mailto:tickets@in.pycon.org)
    and we will help you through the necessary details.
