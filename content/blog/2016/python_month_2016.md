### What is Python Month?

This year, PyCon India is celebrating the month from 10th, August to 10th, September as Python Month, with the aim of increasing the awareness and awesomeness of Python Programming Language within the student community in India.


### How you can help?

Python month will be organized and run by volunteers, anyone who wants to participate is welcome, and all help is appreciated.

This is a large task to handle and therefore requires a lot of volunteer support. Create an account in [Python Express web application](https://pythonexpress.in) and become a volunteer. Here is how you can help.

1. If you are a Python programmer, and please give a talk/workshop at a college in your city.
2. If you are a professor or student, please facilitate a workshop in your college. Request a workshop in [Python Express site](https://pythonexpress.in). A volunteer will follow up about facilities and tutor.
3. Help us in coordinating Python Month by talking to colleges to arrange workshops.
4. Pass on the message to college students in your circle, friends, etc...

### What are these workshop?

We can conduct four types of workshops.

1. Basic Python Workshop
2. Machine learning using Python Workshop
3. Django Web Development Workshop
4. Rest API development using Python Workshop

Most of the tutors are volunteers, requesting the workshop as early as possible will ensure volunteers to co-ordinate.

### I have previously conducted a workshop, what should I do?
