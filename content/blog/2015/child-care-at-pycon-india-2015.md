Summary: PyCon India 2015 - Announcing Child Care facility.

Providing child care at [PyCon India](http://in.pycon.org/) is something that has been on our minds for more than a few years now. Empowering the parents to attend the talks and network around the conference tension free, knowing that their children are in good hands. This year we've teamed up with professionals in order to make this happen and hope to give the kids a nice time as well during the conference!

If you would like to sign up for this service, please choose `Yes` for the question `Would you like to avail Child care facility?`, which will be asked during [online registration](https://in.explara.com/e/pycon-india-2015).

While we'd love every parent attending the conference to take advantage of this service, we have to keep in mind the Venue bandwidth and man power as well. Those being taken into consideration, we only have 25 slots, which will be offered on a First Come First Serve basis. So if you would like to sign up for it, we suggest you to fill in your name right away!

We will personally start reaching out to the parents who have opted for this service a month before the conference in order to understand their specific expectations better. The fee for the service is Rs. 500 per day per child.

Just to add to that, why not give your kids a chance to watch their parents stand up and teach a lot of people? [Go ahead and propose a session, will ya?](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/pycon-india-2015/proposals/)
