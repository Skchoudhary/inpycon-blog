Summary: PyCon India 2015 - Dev sprint announcement and planning.

When we say we strive to make [PyCon India](https://in.pycon.org/2015/) better, we mean it. Concentrating on talk qualities, being inclusive and then getting onto having top notch workshops, believe it or not, PyCon India has never had a Dev Sprint. That, my friends, is going to be fixed this year!

We are planning on conducting Dev sprints all across India within Local User Groups starting from this month onwards. If you would like to participate or offer suggestions, please join the [inpycon mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/inpycon).

Tentatively, the plan is to hold the sprints on October 2nd, Friday, parallel to the workshops. We will make the announcement as soon as the plan is finalized.

Don't forget to [grab your tickets](https://in.explara.com/e/pycon-india-2015) and [put in a talk proposal](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/pycon-india-2015/proposals/) though!
