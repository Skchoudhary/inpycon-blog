PyCon India is one of *the* most affordable and entirely community run professional conferences in India, and we strive to keep it that way. As much as we try, inflation is just something that we can't do much about and hence, the small changes will reflect. Here are the pricing tiers for this year's conference:

1. Early Python          : Rs. 1000 (150 tickets. No cancellation. Transferable)
2. Regular Python        : Rs. 1200 
3. Late Python           : Rs. 1800
4. Student Python        : Rs. 1000
5. On-the-spot Python    : Rs. 2500 (For two days)
6. Workshop Python       : Rs. 1000 Per workshop

Tickets 1 to 5 gives you full access to the conference for two days, including breakfast, lunch, tea & snacks and a T-shirt. The workshop ticket has to be bought separately for each workshop that you want to attend. We'll announce them as soon as we finalize them.
