**What is an Open Space?**

Open Space [(register here)](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/pycon-india-2015-open-spaces/proposals/) is a way for people to come together to talk about topics, ideas or whatever they want. Any subject that two or more attendees want to talk about is a candidate for an Open Space. 
Speak about your favorite library, framework, tool, experience, lessons learnt, Discuss code, design, philosophy, editors. Show what projects you are working on. Share what problem you face, what solution looking for, what improvements you would like to see.
Smaller group generally leads to a lot more discussions, encourages the audience to ask more questions and keep things lively.
